Such representative is justified by the solution properties of dynamic problem. And the specific function form is estimated by non parametric method.

Limitation of this approach:
- not allow serial correlation in any input price (assume econometricians cannnot observe input price). Solved by ACF 2015 EMCA.
- many firms have zero investment, which violates the monotonicity assumption of the solution of i. Solved by LP using middle input.}
