annote = {Solve the simultaneouty problem and selection bias problem. The main idea is to use current capital and last period invest as instruments for unobserved productivity shock. Such representative is justified by the solution properties of dynamic problem. And the specific function form is estimated by non parametric method.

Limitation of this approach:
- not allow serial correlation in any input price (assume econometricians cannnot observe input price). Solved by ACF 2015 EMCA.
- many firms have zero investment, which violates the monotonicity assumption of the solution of i. Solved by LP using middle input.}
